<span class="fas fa-tag" aria-hidden=true></span>&nbsp;<a href=/tags/fifo/ rel=tag>fifo</a></p></header>With 0.4.3 FiFo introduces support for LeoFS and this allows for some quite nice new features. Most importantly it decouples FiFo's operations from storing big amounts of data which makes maintaining either of this much more sensible and scaling storage much more easy.
Then again while nice that is not the important part, just storing datasets somewhere else does not make much of a difference for most users but what LoeFS allows FiFo to store much more data then would be good in the old setup.

<span class="fas fa-tag" aria-hidden=true></span>&nbsp;<a href=/tags/erlang/ rel=tag>erlang</a></p></header>Following the article about Asynchronous garbage collection with CRDTs I experimented with implementing the concept. The OR Set is a very nice data structure for this since it's rather simple and so is it's garbage!
To garbage collect the OR Set we do the following, we take some of the elements of the remove set, and delete them from both the add and the remove set - this way we save the space for them and generate a new baseline.

<span class="fas fa-tag" aria-hidden=true></span>&nbsp;<a href=/tags/erlang/ rel=tag>erlang</a></p></header>So CRDTs are very very nice data structures awesome for eventual consistent applications like riak, or the components of Project-FiFo. So they have one big drawback, most of them collect garbage, and over time that can sum up to a lot making them pretty unpractical in many cases. Collecting this garbage is a bit tricky, since usually it means synchronising the data - which going back to the eventual consistent stuff prevents either A or P.

When I started Project FiFo a year ago it was more of a tiny hobby project and I could have sworn it would stand in row with all the other little open source projects no one would ever give a damn about.

But that's boring, no one likes reading manuals, we, as engineers, like to try things out (aka. break stuff).
Only downside with that is that we need to set things up before we can break them, or even worst need to un-break it later to try out different things (aka.

Gies</p></header>As promised in a previous post I'll talk a bit about writing tests for riak_test. To start with the obvious it's pretty simple and pretty awesome. riak_test gives you the tools you've dreamed of when testing distributed riak_core applications:
a backchannel to communicate and execute commands on the nodes. a nice and way to bring up and tear down the test environment. helper functions to deal with the riak_core cluster.

That said if you have a riak_core app this posts should get you started on how to test it with riak_test. We'll not go through the topic of how to write the tests itself, this might come in a later post also the riak_kv tests are a good point to start.

Gies</p></header>Preamble Lets start with this, Erlang releases are super useful they are one of the features I like most about Erlang - you get out an entirely self contained package you can deploy and forget, no library trouble, no wrong version of the VM no trouble at all.
BUT (this had to come didn't it) sometimes they are limiting and kind of inflexible, adding a tiny little feature means rolling out a new release, with automated builds that is not so bad but &lsquo;not so bad&rsquo; isn't good either.

Gies</p></header>I've had some open source projects before, actually quite some, but Project FiFo is by far the most successful one. And aside from the technical perspective I've learned a tremendous amount of new things already, one of which I want so share since. It sounds simple but I never looked at it this way before: Tickets.
The project has caught on momentum so fast that at &lsquo;rush hours&rsquo; people come with questions, bug reports and feature requests at rate that it's they pile up faster then we can help or answer, the channel and community already does a great job &lsquo;filtering&rsquo; out easy to answer topics but enough are complicated to a point where a developer has to look at them.

Gies</p></header>Some nice additions to the little Erlang DTrace demo. For once I've added a filed to input custom scripts which are run on the server which is pretty neat since it allows running all kind of (l)quantize based scripts from the server and get a nice heatmap.
Like how about the heatmap of how Erlang function call times?
The script used (also included in the repository):
erlang*:::global-function-entry { self->funcall_entry_ts[copyinstr(arg1)] = vtimestamp; } erlang*:::function-return { @time[copyinstr(arg1)] = lquantize((vtimestamp - self->funcall_entry_ts[copyinstr(arg1)] ) / 1000, 0, 63, 2); } Now that is already cool but there is more, in addition to there is a page now that allows to show list based queries (as count or sum) so for example it would be very easy to get a profiling of an Erlang program like this:
