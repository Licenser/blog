Simplified, the throughput the benchmark recorded went down, from 341 MB/s on a MBP to 136 MB/s on a Threadripper desktop. Prior I had read Daniel Lemire's notes on the sub optimal performance for simdjson on Zen 2, which is heavily used in the benchmark, but the suggested drop were a few percent not half.</description></item></channel></rss>
