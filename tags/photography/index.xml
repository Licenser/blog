This month it has been harder, I've not had many photos I found interesting. I did switch form ATOMAL to XT-3 to try how replenishment affects development and if I can save some waste by using that process. So far mixed results the times XT-3 takes are very different and some of the films came out hooriby overexposed o.O; so I think I slowly start to find the right times.</description></item><item><title>Photo of the Month May 2022</title><link>https://blog.licenser.net/2022/06/photo-of-the-month-may-2022/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2022 16:09:56 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.licenser.net/2022/06/photo-of-the-month-may-2022/</guid><description>Okay another month passed so I got another Photo Of The Month, and only 3 month in I'm already going to cheat and share two photos. So much for consistency. But hear me out, only one of them is the Photo Of The Month. We'll talk a bit about why.
Letâ€™s start with my favorite photo of May, which ironically is not going to be the Photo Of The Month. The following photo came to be because I pulled ADOX CMS 20 II by a stop during development.</description></item><item><title>Photo of the Month April 2022</title><link>https://blog.licenser.net/2022/05/photo-of-the-month-april-2022/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2022 16:09:56 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.licenser.net/2022/05/photo-of-the-month-april-2022/</guid><description>Huzza, it's the second month of my attempt to publish a photo of the month. This month I was very excited the entire month since the photo for this month is one I love.
It's shot in black and white, with an amazing film, ADOX CMS 20 II with the Nikon F4 with a 50mm f/1.8 prime lens. I love how much detail the film can capture. Any grain is from the digital camera rather than the film.</description></item><item><title>Stand Development</title><link>https://blog.licenser.net/2022/04/stand-development/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Apr 2022 15:48:58 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.licenser.net/2022/04/stand-development/</guid><description>Let's talk about something different today, photography! Or, more precisely, developing black and white film.
I found that when I started, I didn't quite find a source that gave me the starting point I needed. That's not to say that there aren't great resources out there, but it felt like I had to piece things together from many sources, blogs, videos, word of mouth, reports from my crow spies, and match them to what I did and needed.</description></item><item><title>Photo of the Month March 2022</title><link>https://blog.licenser.net/2022/04/photo-of-the-month-march-2022/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Apr 2022 16:09:56 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.licenser.net/2022/04/photo-of-the-month-march-2022/</guid><description>Good news everyone, or bad news if you don't like photography,
I have been taking quite a few photos over the last year and a bit, some good, many bad. It is pretty easy for me to take, develop, scan, and archive my photos, it's a process, and I'm pretty good at following procedures. Sharing my work, not so much. None of the shots are perfect or &amp;ldquo;good enough&amp;rdquo; for the (perhaps much too high) standard I hold myself to, so I tend to take them, file them away and move on.</description></item></channel></rss>
