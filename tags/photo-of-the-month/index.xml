I have been taking quite a few photos over the last year and a bit, some good, many bad. It is pretty easy for me to take, develop, scan, and archive my photos, it's a process, and I'm pretty good at following procedures. Sharing my work, not so much. None of the shots are perfect or &amp;ldquo;good enough&amp;rdquo; for the (perhaps much too high) standard I hold myself to, so I tend to take them, file them away and move on.</description></item></channel></rss>
