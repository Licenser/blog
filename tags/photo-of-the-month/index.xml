This month I was very excited the entire month since the photo for this month is one I love.
It's shot in black and white, with an amazing film, ADOX CMS 20 II with the Nikon F4 with a 50mm f/1.8 prime lens. I love how much detail the film can capture. Any grain is from the digital camera rather than the film.</description></item><item><title>Photo of the Month March 2022</title><link>https://blog.licenser.net/2022/04/photo-of-the-month-march-2022/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Apr 2022 16:09:56 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.licenser.net/2022/04/photo-of-the-month-march-2022/</guid><description>Good news everyone, or bad news if you don't like photography,
I have been taking quite a few photos over the last year and a bit, some good, many bad. It is pretty easy for me to take, develop, scan, and archive my photos, it's a process, and I'm pretty good at following procedures. Sharing my work, not so much. None of the shots are perfect or &amp;ldquo;good enough&amp;rdquo; for the (perhaps much too high) standard I hold myself to, so I tend to take them, file them away and move on.</description></item></channel></rss>
