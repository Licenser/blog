We'll talk a bit about why.</p><p>Let’s start with my favorite photo of May, which ironically is not going to be the Photo Of The Month. The following photo came to be because I pulled ADOX CMS 20 II by a stop during development. Adox suggests shooting it at 12 ISO not 20 during sunny days, so I thought - lets shoot it with 20 and develop it as if it were 12. Turns out the results are cool. The photo looks heavy and has a strong dark mood to it.</p><p><img src=/images/potm/2022-05-1.jpg alt="A bright white building against a dark sky that is reflected in nearly pitch black water."></p><p>And while I find this looks incredible cool, and is technically interesting, it's not what I picked as a photo of the month. Instead, this gem is what I selected.</p><p><img src=/images/potm/2022-05-2.jpg alt="A wall with a window, trees and a house reflecting in it. There are blinds on top of each window half, one of them broken hanging down in a odd angle."></p><p>So why this image. Because the process of taking it was special to me. It was taken on a two or three hour walk as the only photo I took during the walk. I've been trying to be more deliberate with my photos, more conscious about what I shoot and instead of &ldquo;snapping&rdquo; everything that comes to mind, find a motive, understand it fully, and photograph it in a way I find right. The shot is taken on Fomo 100 with a 4x5 large format camera, so setting it up is a act, metering it is interesting and you got to pick careful because you won't see the results until you're home. It worked out, I really like the shot, it looks how I envisioned it so honestly, I'm very proud of that. There we go, that’s why it's the photo of the month.</p><hr><footer><section><h4>Share</h4><nav class="nav sharing-icons"><a class=nav-item href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2fblog.licenser.net%2f2022%2f06%2fphoto-of-the-month-may-2022%2f" title="Share on Facebook"><span class="fab fa-facebook-f fa-2x" aria-hidden=true></span></a><a class=nav-item href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3a%2f%2fblog.licenser.net%2f2022%2f06%2fphoto-of-the-month-may-2022%2f" title="Share on LinkedIn"><span class="fab fa-linkedin-in fa-2x" aria-hidden=true></span></a><a class=nav-item href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3a%2f%2fblog.licenser.net%2f2022%2f06%2fphoto-of-the-month-may-2022%2f&text=Photo%20of%20the%20Month%20May%202022" title="Tweet this"><span class="fab fa-twitter fa-2x"></span></a></nav></section><div id=disqus_thread></div><script type=application/javascript>var disqus_config=function(){};(function(){if(["localhost","127.0.0.1"].indexOf(window.location.hostname)!=-1){document.getElementById('disqus_thread').innerHTML='Disqus comments not available by default when the website is previewed locally.';return;}
