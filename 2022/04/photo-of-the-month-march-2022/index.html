<span class="fas fa-tag" aria-hidden=true></span>&nbsp;<a href=/tags/photography/ rel=tag>photography</a>, <a href=/tags/photo-of-the-month/ rel=tag>photo of the month</a></p></header><p>Good news everyone, or bad news if you don't like photography,</p><p>I have been taking quite a few photos over the last year and a bit, some good, many bad. It is pretty easy for me to take, develop, scan, and archive my photos, it's a process, and I'm pretty good at following procedures. Sharing my work, not so much. None of the shots are perfect or &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; for the (perhaps much too high) standard I hold myself to, so I tend to take them, file them away and move on.</p><p>I genuinely think, however, that that's not a very healthy thing to do when learning. So I figured, even if I'm not satisfied with the shit, each month, I'll pick one of the photos I took, the one I like the most, and share it, along with why I personally like it. If for no other reason, then go back in a year and look how my photography changed.</p><p>So here we go, March 2022. Shot on <a href=https://filmwashi.com/en/products/135_films/>WASHI-A</a> a super interesting 12 ISO (yap 12, not 120) black and white film. I like how much that looks like out of a dream. It's not focused correctly (shame on me), but that doesn't take away from it. The glow from the film makes it look a bit unreal. I would have preferred to pan a bit further to the left, capturing more of the shadows balancing the light on the right and dark on the left.</p><p><img src=/images/potm/2022-03.jpg alt="a man sitting on a bench"></p><hr><footer><section><h4>Share</h4><nav class="nav sharing-icons"><a class=nav-item href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2fblog.licenser.net%2f2022%2f04%2fphoto-of-the-month-march-2022%2f" title="Share on Facebook"><span class="fab fa-facebook-f fa-2x" aria-hidden=true></span></a><a class=nav-item href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3a%2f%2fblog.licenser.net%2f2022%2f04%2fphoto-of-the-month-march-2022%2f" title="Share on LinkedIn"><span class="fab fa-linkedin-in fa-2x" aria-hidden=true></span></a><a class=nav-item href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3a%2f%2fblog.licenser.net%2f2022%2f04%2fphoto-of-the-month-march-2022%2f&text=Photo%20of%20the%20Month%20March%202022" title="Tweet this"><span class="fab fa-twitter fa-2x"></span></a></nav></section><div id=disqus_thread></div><script type=application/javascript>var disqus_config=function(){};(function(){if(["localhost","127.0.0.1"].indexOf(window.location.hostname)!=-1){document.getElementById('disqus_thread').innerHTML='Disqus comments not available by default when the website is previewed locally.';return;}
