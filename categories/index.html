I'm starting to get the hang of sharing a photo a month. This month sure was easier than last time.
This time, I got a frame I tried to take a few times until the right conditions came together. The right weather, the right sky, and not too much foot traffic cause distractions.
I wanted the person in the photo to wear something light to contrast against the darker tones of the bridge - I cheated and asked for help, so the person in the shot was placed.

This month it has been harder, I've not had many photos I found interesting. I did switch form ATOMAL to XT-3 to try how replenishment affects development and if I can save some waste by using that process. So far mixed results the times XT-3 takes are very different and some of the films came out hooriby overexposed o.O; so I think I slowly start to find the right times.

So much for consistency. But hear me out, only one of them is the Photo Of The Month. We'll talk a bit about why.
Let’s start with my favorite photo of May, which ironically is not going to be the Photo Of The Month. The following photo came to be because I pulled ADOX CMS 20 II by a stop during development.

This month I was very excited the entire month since the photo for this month is one I love.
It's shot in black and white, with an amazing film, ADOX CMS 20 II with the Nikon F4 with a 50mm f/1.8 prime lens. I love how much detail the film can capture. Any grain is from the digital camera rather than the film.

I found that when I started, I didn't quite find a source that gave me the starting point I needed. That's not to say that there aren't great resources out there, but it felt like I had to piece things together from many sources, blogs, videos, word of mouth, reports from my crow spies, and match them to what I did and needed.

I have been taking quite a few photos over the last year and a bit, some good, many bad. It is pretty easy for me to take, develop, scan, and archive my photos, it's a process, and I'm pretty good at following procedures. Sharing my work, not so much. None of the shots are perfect or &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; for the (perhaps much too high) standard I hold myself to, so I tend to take them, file them away and move on.

<span class="fas fa-tag" aria-hidden=true></span>&nbsp;<a href=/tags/rust/ rel=tag>rust</a></p></header>I recently ran some benchmarks on a Threadripper 3960X system and the results were surprising me quite a bit. Simplified, the throughput the benchmark recorded went down, from 341 MB/s on a MBP to 136 MB/s on a Threadripper desktop. Prior I had read Daniel Lemire's notes on the sub optimal performance for simdjson on Zen 2, which is heavily used in the benchmark, but the suggested drop were a few percent not half.

To be honest as a long term MacBook user I expected a rather disapointing experience but to my big surprise I do really like it so far. But enough of a preamble. Why I'm writing this? Because I figured that the mistakes I made, the hints I got all over the place would have really helped me if someone had collected them - so I do that now.

So with a backpack, hiking shoes, food for about a week and a direct line to the rebar3 IRC channel I set off to migrate sniffle from rebar2 to rebar3.

<span class="fas fa-tag" aria-hidden=true></span>&nbsp;<a href=/tags/fifo/ rel=tag>fifo</a></p></header>Symptoms After a full network outage in a larger system (7 FiFo instances and, a few dozen of hypervisors, VM's in the 3 digit number) a small percentage of the VM's stored in FiFo lost information which package was assigned to them and which organization they belong to.
Technical background As part of planned maintenance on the switching layer the entire network was taken down. Effectively cutting the communication between any two systems in the network.
