Gies</p></header><p>I've recently gotten a Dell XPS 15&rdquo; 2-in-1 and started using it as a development environment for the last week. To be honest as a long term MacBook user I expected a rather disapointing experience but to my big surprise I do really like it so far. But enough of a preamble. Why I'm writing this? Because I figured that the mistakes I made, the hints I got all over the place would have really helped me if someone had collected them - so I do that now. Mind you a lot of it is not specific to the Dell and will work for every system.</p><h2 id=the-goal>The goal</h2><p>Let's set expecations. This is not about making the perfect system, after all a week isn't enough to decide what perfect is and find out all the little things that need to get tweeked. The goal here is to get a &lsquo;good enough&rsquo; system that works for most everything without regretting it or missing my MacBook in as little time as possible.</p><h2 id=the-os>The OS</h2><p>I suspect many people will be surprised but I decided to stay with windows as a operating system, partially because I've not the best opinion on Linux (which I'm not going to discuss here) and partially because I wanted to see how good the out of the box experience is. Last but not least the whole 2-in-1 experience seems to be excelently integreated with the OS and I'm a bit scared to have to fight a different OS to get it all working as it'd be two unknowns to fight instead of just one.</p><p>WSL is brilliant, I've had very little problems (read none but one super esoteric one we'll get to later) with it.</p><h2 id=my-setp>My setp</h2><p>To my great fortune I do use Eemacs which means that my environment of choice works nearly everywhere. OSX, Linux, Windows, WSL, there is an Emacs. Other then that I obviously need my Erlang, I really can't go without it ;). In addition I tossed in some rust and since I'm writing this post on the XPS ruby. The usual suspects, gcc, make, git and friends come with the terretory.</p><p>My initial attempt was to run things on windows. I tried VS code and windos emacs. Erlang, rust, git all exist as native windows binaries but the whole experience wasn't great especially since in the end it'll run on a unix or unix like system anyhow. So in the end I used WSL for help and just set everything up there.</p><h3 id=ubuntu-1804>Ubuntu 18.04</h3><p>The WSL installation I picked. I don't want to go into a distribution war and I'm sure all other distributions just work as well - pick your favourite I simply know ubuntu a bit better then I know SuSe (the alternative from the app store) and can't be bothered to find out how to add additional distributions.</p><p>Most of everything comes in <code>apt</code>, with the exception of rust which uses <a href=https://rustup.rs>rustup</a> and erlang wich I fetched the <a href=https://www.erlang-solutions.com/resources/download.html>ESL package</a> for to get around ubuntus horrible decision to split up erlang in multiple packages (seriously WTF?!?).</p><h3 id=emacs>Emacs</h3><p>I use <a href=http://spacemacs.org/>space emacs</a> which installes without problems on WSL, just clone the reposit and call it a day. It'll ask you for additions for languages as you open the files, a lot exist but if you do something that's more esoteric then erlang you might have to do some additional fiddling.</p><p>Here comes the first issue, WSL does not have an X server (I really hope at some point Microsoft will add one) but in the meantime <a href=https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/>VcXsrv</a> works quite well.</p><p>You can add it to auto-start too which helps! After running it the first time it'll ask you to save the config, do so and then run windows-r and enter <code>shell:startup</code> to open the folder for auto-start, drop the file in there and call it a day.</p><p>Once <code>X</code> is started you need to tell the WSL shell where your display is you can do that by adding the line <code>export DISPLAY=localhost:0</code> at the end of the <code>~/.profile</code> file.</p><p>With that all set you should have a running emacs, feel free to skip the the next section or keep reading here if you want to know a few more fancies.</p><p>I really like the <a href=https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode>Fira Code</a> font, fortunately it comes with ubuntu so you can install it by running <code>sudo install fonts-firacode</code>. To enable it in emacs you can follow <a href=https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/wiki/Emacs-instructions>their tutorial</a>. Here is the gotcha I talked about while the font works I've not yet managed to get the code points to work, but it's not that big of a deal to me.</p><p>A second fancy but not required thing is a Emacs desktop icon. I really wanted the option to just click it and make it start without having to go through bash and running a command or having a console window open. There is a simple trick for that. Create a VB script somewhere with the follow content:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-basic data-lang=basic>Set oShell <span style=color:#f92672>=</span> CreateObject (<span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;Wscript.Shell&#34;</span>) 
Dim strArgs
strArgs <span style=color:#f92672>=</span> <span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;bash -c ~/start-emacs&#34;</span>
oShell<span style=color:#f92672>.</span>Run strArgs, <span style=color:#ae81ff>0</span>, false
</code></pre></div><p>and a shell script in your home directory called start-emacs:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=color:#75715e>#!/bin/sh
</span><span style=color:#75715e></span>
export DISPLAY<span style=color:#f92672>=</span>localhost:0
emacs
</code></pre></div><p>That's it you can then link that to the laptop and give it the nice <a href=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nashamri/spacemacs-logo/master/spacemacs.ico>spacemacs icon</a>.</p><h3 id=windows--the-hardware>Windows / The hardware</h3><p>There are a few tweaks to the system I hade to make it more frinedly to my use (read MY use, so YMMV).</p><h3 id=touchpad>Touchpad</h3><p>The touchpad just isn't at par with Apples touchpad, honestly none is and I suspect if you ever used a MacBook's touchpad you easiely agree. But XPS is one of the better ones, probably the best on a PC I've ever used and there are a few tweaks that make it more user friendly.</p><ol><li>Disable tap to click, it's just super annoying if you're used the Mac touchpad.</li><li>disable the right side as a right click, two fingers like on the Mac just work fine and feel more natura (to a mac user).</li><li>Set 3 finger gestures to &ldquo;Switching Desktops and showing desktops&rdquo;.</li></ol><h3 id=keyboad>Keyboad</h3><p>The XPS uses what dell calls a maglev keyboard, which sounds really cool, it also types quite well. It's a bit clicky, that's not for everyone but pressing the key is distinct and you don't get this &ldquo;did I press it or not&rdquo; feeling. Not good or bad but I noticed that compared to the Mac the alt and ctrl keys are placed different. While on the Mac FN and Command/apple/windows are on the outside and alt and ctrl are on the inside the Dell does it the oposite way around. It takes some time to get used to but I think after a few days the way it's on the Dell feels more natural and better reachable (I still press Windows-D instead of Alt-D way too often :P).</p><p>Now the downer. Dell has made the horrible deicsion to put the page up/down keys right about the arrow keys. I hate it. It's unnatural and trying to count the time I went a page up instead of left resulted in an integer overflow. Fortunately Kevin suggested a toll called <a href=https://www.autohotkey.com/>AutoHotkey</a>. A simple script like this:</p><pre><code>PgUp::Left
PgDn::Right
</code></pre><p>sovles the problem. AHK translates it to a standalone executable that you can put into the auto-start folder mentioned above. Effectively this re-binds the page up/down keys to left/right so that no matter which you end up hitting you get the arrow keys.</p><hr><footer><section><h4>Share</h4><nav class="nav sharing-icons"><a class=nav-item href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2fblog.licenser.net%2f2018%2f05%2fdell-xps%2fwindows-as-a-dev-env%2f" title="Share on Facebook"><span class="fab fa-facebook-f fa-2x" aria-hidden=true></span></a><a class=nav-item href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3a%2f%2fblog.licenser.net%2f2018%2f05%2fdell-xps%2fwindows-as-a-dev-env%2f" title="Share on LinkedIn"><span class="fab fa-linkedin-in fa-2x" aria-hidden=true></span></a><a class=nav-item href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3a%2f%2fblog.licenser.net%2f2018%2f05%2fdell-xps%2fwindows-as-a-dev-env%2f&text=Dell%20XPS%2fWindows%20as%20a%20dev%20env" title="Tweet this"><span class="fab fa-twitter fa-2x"></span></a></nav></section><div id=disqus_thread></div><script type=application/javascript>var disqus_config=function(){};(function(){if(["localhost","127.0.0.1"].indexOf(window.location.hostname)!=-1){document.getElementById('disqus_thread').innerHTML='Disqus comments not available by default when the website is previewed locally.';return;}
